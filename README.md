Open Source Secure Web Gateway

Hi,

The Secure Web Gateway (Web Application/API/Website security) that I built using open source is available in youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGBFp1bwadxjrA-MgwD2rTA , you can share it to your engineers or students or community forums, they can build/modify it themselves as they will have access to my source codes, just in case if they need support they can reach me.I did those videos in tamil.

Thanks
