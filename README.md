<h1>Open Source Secure Web Gateway</h1>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>The Secure Web Gateway (Web Application/API/Website security) that I built using open source is available on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGBFp1bwadxjrA-MgwD2rTA" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>. You can share it with your engineers, students, or community forums. They can build or modify it themselves as they will have access to my source codes. If they need support, they can reach out to me. I did those videos in Tamil.</p>

<p>Thanks,<br>
